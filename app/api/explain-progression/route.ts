For example, for C - G - Am - F: "This progression in **C Major** uses **G** (dominant) to create tension towards **Am** (relative minor), with **F** (subdominant) often leading back to C. It's a common and effective pop progression."
For Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7: "A classic **ii-V-I** in C Major. **Dm7** leads to the tension of **G7** (dominant), which strongly resolves to the stable **Cmaj7** (tonic). Fundamental in jazz."
